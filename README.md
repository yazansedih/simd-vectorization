<h1>SIMD Vectorization</h1>
SIMD Vectorization, related to SIMD vectorization using Intel SSE instructions for 
matrix-vector and matrix-matrix multiplication.The assignment involves using 
GCC, understanding SSE intrinsics, and implementing vectorized versions of 
these operations: 
1- Vector-Vector Multiplication: 
This mode compares the performance of scalar and vectorized implementations 
of vector-vector multiplication. The table presents the execution times for 
different input sizes (128, 256, 512). 
2- Matrix-Vector Multiplication: 
This mode compares the performance of scalar and vectorized implementations 
of matrix-vector multiplication. The table provides execution times for different 
input sizes (128, 256, 512). 
3- Matrix-Matrix Multiplication: 
This mode compares the performance of scalar and vectorized implementations 
of matrix-matrix multiplication. Execution times are reported for different input 
sizes (128, 256, 512).
